# Wildfire
Python simulation of a wildfire spreading through a forest

There are 2 display options : through command terminal or by using TKinter (I definitely recommend going for the TKinter one)

The TKinter display is not responsive, that means you need to close the window to see the wildfire spreading for each iteration
